        id="ManifestOrder"
        severity="Warning"
        message="`&lt;uses-sdk>` tag appears after `&lt;application>` tag"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="5"
        summary="Incorrect order of elements in manifest"
        explanation="The &lt;application> tag should appear after the elements which declare which version you need, which features you need, which libraries you need, and so on. In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting applied correctly) when the `&lt;application>` tag appears before some of these other elements, so it&apos;s best to order your manifest in the logical dependency order."

    <issue
        id="GradleOverrides"
        severity="Warning"
        message="This `targetSdkVersion` value (`27`) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (`27`)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Value overridden by Gradle build script"
        explanation="The value of (for example) `minSdkVersion` is only used if it is not specified in the `build.gradle` build scripts. When specified in the Gradle build scripts, the manifest value is ignored and can be misleading, so should be removed to avoid ambiguity."
